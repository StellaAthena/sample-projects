# Sample Projects

A collection of self-contained research project prompts for screening prospective research collaborators.

## Structure

Each subdirectory contains a single project with its own description, goals, and relevant background. Projects are designed to be tackled independently — pick one that interests you and see what you can come up with.

## Getting Started

Browse the subdirectories to find a project that interests you. Each project README will explain the problem, provide relevant context, and describe what a good solution looks like.
